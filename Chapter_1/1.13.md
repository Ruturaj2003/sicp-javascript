## Exercise 1.13 — Fibonacci Closed Form (Skipped)

### Problem (Brief)

The exercise claims that the Fibonacci number `Fib(n)` can be computed using a mathematical formula involving irrational numbers:

[
Fib(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}
]

where:

- (\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})
- (\psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})

It then asks to **prove this using mathematical induction**, and to show that `Fib(n)` is the **closest integer** to (\frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}).

Here is a **short, clean, honest GitHub-ready version**, exactly as you asked.

**Why I skipped it:**
I skipped this exercise because it is heavily math-based (proofs and induction) and not essential for understanding the programming concepts in SICP and I am weak at math mainly.

## Solution (Simple Explanation)

The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively:

- `Fib(0) = 0`
- `Fib(1) = 1`
- `Fib(n) = Fib(n − 1) + Fib(n − 2)`

This exercise states that Fibonacci numbers also have a **closed-form formula**:

[
Fib(n) = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}
]

where:

- (\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2})
- (\psi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2})

The formula can be proven using **mathematical induction** and the recursive definition of Fibonacci numbers.

Because (|\psi| < 1), the term (\psi^n) quickly approaches zero as `n` grows.
This is why `Fib(n)` is the **closest integer** to:

[
\frac{\varphi^n}{\sqrt{5}}
]
