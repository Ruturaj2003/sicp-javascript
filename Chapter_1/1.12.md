# Pascal’s Triangle — Recursive Computation of an Element

## Problem Statement

Pascal’s triangle is a number pattern with the following rules:

```
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
...
```

- All numbers on the **edges** of the triangle are `1`
- Every **inner** number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it

The task is to **write a function that computes a single element** of Pascal’s triangle using a **recursive process**.

## My Initial Mistakes and Misunderstandings

While solving this problem, I made a few conceptual mistakes before arriving at the correct solution:

1. **I initially thought in terms of printing the triangle**
   This was incorrect. The problem is not about generating or displaying the triangle, but about computing **one specific element** given its position.

2. **I confused structure with data**
   At first, I tried to reason about row length as if the triangle were stored in memory. In reality, Pascal’s triangle here is not a data structure — it is a **rule-based definition**.

3. **I underestimated base cases**
   I originally focused only on `row === 1`. I later understood that **every edge element** (first and last position of any row) is a base case and must return `1`.

4. **I forgot that every recursive branch must return a value**
   Computing a value is not enough — the function must explicitly return it, otherwise the recursion breaks.

These mistakes helped clarify what the problem was _really_ testing: translating a self-referential definition into a terminating recursive process.

## Final Correct Solution

The function below computes the value at a given `(row, position)` by directly encoding the rules of Pascal’s triangle.

```js
function findVal(row, position) {
  // Base case: first row
  if (row === 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Base case: edges of the triangle
  if (position === 1 || position === row) {
    return 1;
  }

  // Recursive case: sum of the two values above
  return findVal(row - 1, position - 1) + findVal(row - 1, position);
}
```

## Key Takeaway

This problem is not about Pascal’s triangle itself.
It is about learning how to:

- Identify **base cases**
- Express a problem in terms of **smaller versions of itself**
- Ensure that every recursive path **terminates and returns a value**

Once I stopped thinking about output and started thinking about **rules and dependencies**, the solution became straightforward.
