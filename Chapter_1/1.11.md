## Exercise 1.11

A function **f** is defined by the rules:

- **f(n) = n** if _n < 3_
- **f(n) = f(n − 1) + 2f(n − 2) + 3f(n − 3)** if _n ≥ 3_

Write:

1. A JavaScript function that computes **f** using a **recursive process**
2. A JavaScript function that computes **f** using an **iterative process**

## Solution

### 1️⃣ Recursive Version (Direct Definition)

```js
function energyCal(days) {
  if (days === 0) return 0;
  if (days === 1) return 1;
  if (days === 2) return 2;

  return (
    energyCal(days - 1) + 2 * energyCal(days - 2) + 3 * energyCal(days - 3)
  );
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Iterative Version (Same Meaning, Efficient Process)

```js
function eC(days) {
  if (days === 0) return 0;
  if (days === 1) return 1;
  if (days === 2) return 2;

  // f(2), f(1), f(0)
  let prev1 = 2;
  let prev2 = 1;
  let prev3 = 0;

  for (let i = 3; i <= days; i++) {
    const todayEnergy = prev1 + 2 * prev2 + 3 * prev3;

    // slide the state forward
    prev3 = prev2;
    prev2 = prev1;
    prev1 = todayEnergy;
  }

  return prev1;
}
```

## ❌ Mistakes I Made While Solving This

### 🟥 Conceptual Mistakes (Important)

1.  **Calling the function inside the iterative loop**  
    Using `eC(i - 1)`, `eC(i - 2)`, etc. made the solution recursive.  
    An iterative process must have **zero self-calls** after the loop starts.
2.  **Accumulating values instead of advancing state**  
    I tracked a running total, but the problem only asks for **f(n)**.
3.  **Not preserving variable meaning**  
    Variables must consistently represent:

    - `f(i - 1)`
    - `f(i - 2)`
    - `f(i - 3)`  
      Overwriting values too early broke the logic.

4.  **Recomputing instead of evolving**  
    Iteration should **carry state forward**, not recompute past values.

### 🟨 Structural Mistakes

5.  **Updating variables in the wrong order**  
    Overwriting newer values before saving older ones destroyed information.  
    Fixed by sliding state from **oldest → newest**.

### 🟦 JavaScript / Mechanical Mistakes

6.  Misspelled `return` as `retunr`
7.  Used inconsistent function names (`eneryCal` vs `energyCal`)
8.  Wrote invalid syntax like `const function eC(...)`
9.  Used illegal variable names starting with numbers
10. Used `const` for variables that needed reassignment

11. Declared `const todayEnergy;` without initialization

12. Forgot to declare the loop variable `i`

These were syntax and hygiene issues, not understanding problems.
