### 1.1.8 Functions as Black-Box Abstractions
This section is saying that the square-root program works because it is built out of many small, well-defined functions that each handle one task. These functions are treated as black boxes: when one function uses another, it does not care how that function is implemented internally, only what result it returns. This idea of hiding details and using functions only based on their inputs and outputs is called a black-box abstraction, and it is one of the most important ideas in programming.
